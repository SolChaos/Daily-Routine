Whenever I need to search up something online whenever I have a question or don't know about something.
And technology (aka Computer Science ) is used for a lot of things such as: Google, Social Media, GPS, Online Banking, Voice assistances like Siri or Alexa, etc.
Well without it, everything as we know would atler and change drastically and dramatically, if this was real here's what it would be like: if uou need to look up something; you would need a book or map, banking would be more old fashion, when wanting to listen to music; you would need to go to either a concert or damn well have someone recreate it, entertainment would most certianly be different than now a days, etc.
So overall, Computer Science is a major thing in our everyday lives whether we recognize it or not.
